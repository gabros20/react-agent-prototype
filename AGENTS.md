# Agent Ground Rules

## Documentation Lookup Protocol

**Next.js 16**: Your training data lacks Next.js 16 knowledge. Use Context7 MCP with relevant keywords before implementing Next.js features.

**ShadCN**: Always retrieve latest component docs via Context7 (`/shadcn/ui` or specific component names). Don't rely on outdated knowledge.

**AI SDK 6**: Not in your knowledge base. Use Context7 for all `ai` package implementations, conventions, examples, streaming patterns, tool definitions, and React hooks etc.

**AI Elements (Vercel)**: Brand new library. Mandatory Context7 lookup for all `@ai-sdk/ui-elements` usage - search by component name or feature.

## File Creation

**NO markdown files** unless explicitly requested by user Do not create markdown files for your summaries, for your changes, for your reports etc. We're trying to work token efficiently So we don't need this. Only do on request.
