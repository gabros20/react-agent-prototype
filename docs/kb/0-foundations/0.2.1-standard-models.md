## Overview

Starting in late 2024 and accelerating through 2025, a new class of language models emerged: **reasoning models** (also called **thinking models**). These models differ fundamentally from standard models in how they approach complex problems, introducing explicit reasoning chains before generating final answers.

**Key Innovation**: Instead of immediately responding, reasoning models **think step-by-step** internally before producing output.

**As of November 2025**: Reasoning models have matured significantly, with multiple providers (OpenAI, DeepSeek, Alibaba Qwen, Moonshot AI) offering both commercial and open-source options.

### Key Research Findings (2024-2025)

-   **Math Performance (AIME 2024)**: o1 achieves 83% vs GPT-4o's 13% (6.4× improvement)
-   **Graduate Science (GPQA)**: o1 achieves 86% vs GPT-4o's 56% (1.5× improvement)
-   **Programming (Codeforces)**: o1 reaches 93rd percentile vs GPT-4o's 11th percentile (8× improvement)
-   **AGI Reasoning (ARC-AGI-1)**: o3 achieves 87.5% (high-compute) vs 0% for GPT-3 in 2020
-   **Cost Trade-off**: Reasoning models cost 10-30× more per token than standard models
-   **Latency Trade-off**: 5-60 seconds vs 0.5-2 seconds for standard models

**Date Verified**: 2025-11-24

## The Problem: When Standard Models Fail

### The Classic Challenge

Standard language models generate text token-by-token immediately upon receiving a prompt. While this works well for most tasks, it struggles with complex reasoning that requires multiple logical steps.

**Example Failure**: Complex mathematics

```
User: "What is 347 × 829?"

GPT-4o (standard model):
- Generates token by token: "347", "×", "829", "is", "approximately"...
- May calculate: "287,663" (sometimes correct, sometimes off by a bit)
- No visible "thinking" - goes straight to answer
- Success rate: ~85% for multi-step math
```

**Problems**:

-   ❌ **Skip logical steps**: Models may jump to conclusions without intermediate reasoning
-   ❌ **Accumulate errors**: Small mistakes in step 1 compound through steps 2, 3, 4
-   ❌ **Limited verification**: No built-in mechanism to check if answer makes sense
-   ❌ **Hallucinate on complexity**: Complex problems trigger confident but wrong responses

### Why This Matters

**Business Impact**:

-   Scientific research: 15-30% error rate in complex calculations leads to wasted experiments
-   Code generation: 40% of complex algorithms fail without explicit reasoning
-   Legal analysis: Missing logical steps creates liability risks
-   Financial modeling: Math errors compound into million-dollar mistakes

**Technical Impact**:

-   Chain-of-thought must be prompted explicitly ("Let's think step by step")
-   Quality of reasoning depends heavily on prompt engineering
-   No guarantee model will reason thoroughly even when prompted

## Core Concept

### What Are Reasoning Models?

Reasoning models are LLMs trained with **Reinforcement Learning (RL)** to generate extensive internal reasoning chains before producing final answers. They **always think step-by-step**, without requiring explicit prompting.

### Visual Representation

**Standard Model (Immediate Response)**:

```
User Prompt → Tokenization → Transformer → Output (token-by-token)
                                ↓
                          Hidden reasoning
                          (implicit, shallow)
```

**Reasoning Model (Think → Answer)**:

```
User Prompt → Internal Reasoning Chain → Final Answer
                        ↓
                [Hidden from user]
                        ↓
           "Let me think about this..."
           Step 1: Parse the problem
           Step 2: Break into subproblems
           Step 3: Solve each subproblem
           Step 4: Verify solution
           Step 5: Combine results
                        ↓
                Final Answer
```

**Training Difference**:

```
Standard Model Training:
Input → Predict Next Token → Compare to Truth → Update Weights

Reasoning Model Training:
Input → Generate Reasoning + Answer → Verify Correctness → Reward/Penalty
    ↓                                          ↓
Longer reasoning = Higher reward (if correct)
Shallow reasoning = Lower reward (if wrong)
    ↓
Model learns: "Complex problem = Think longer"
```

### Key Principles

1. **Native Chain-of-Thought**: Reasoning is built into the model via RL training, not prompt engineering
2. **Verification-Driven**: Models learn to backtrack, verify, and self-correct through reward signals
3. **Adaptive Depth**: Models automatically adjust reasoning length based on problem complexity
4. **Emergent Behaviors**: Backtracking, alternative approaches, and verification emerge naturally from RL

## Implementation Patterns

### Pattern 1: Standard Model with Prompted CoT

**Use Case**: When you need some reasoning but can't afford reasoning model costs

```typescript
import { generateText } from "ai";
import { openai } from "@ai-sdk/openai";

// Explicitly prompt for step-by-step thinking
const { text } = await generateText({
	model: openai("gpt-4o"),
	prompt: `Let's think step by step.

What is 347 × 829?

Show your work:
1. Break down the calculation
2. Compute intermediate steps
3. Verify the final answer`,
});
```

**Pros**:

-   ✅ Fast response (1-3 seconds)
-   ✅ Cost-effective ($0.01-0.10 per 1k tokens)
-   ✅ Works with any standard model

**Cons**:

-   ❌ Quality depends on prompt engineering
-   ❌ No guarantee of thorough reasoning
-   ❌ Reasoning quality varies between runs

**When to Use**: Budget-constrained applications needing basic reasoning

### Pattern 2: Reasoning Model (o1, o3, DeepSeek-R1)

**Use Case**: When accuracy is critical and cost is secondary

```typescript
import { generateText } from "ai";
import { openai } from "@ai-sdk/openai";

// No CoT prompt needed - model reasons automatically
const { text } = await generateText({
	model: openai("o1"),
	prompt: "What is 347 × 829?", // Simple prompt - model handles reasoning
	providerOptions: {
		openai: {
			reasoningEffort: "medium", // low, medium, high
		},
	},
});

// Result: 287,663 (100% accurate with reasoning traces)
```

**Pros**:

-   ✅ Native reasoning (no prompt engineering)
-   ✅ High accuracy (6× better on math/science)
-   ✅ Self-verification built-in
-   ✅ Consistent performance across runs

**Cons**:

-   ❌ Slow (5-60 seconds depending on reasoning effort)
-   ❌ Expensive ($0.15-3.00 per 1k tokens)
-   ❌ Overkill for simple tasks

**When to Use**: Complex math, science, code algorithms, multi-step logic

### Pattern 3: Hybrid Approach (Best of Both Worlds)

**Use Case**: Production systems optimizing cost and quality

```typescript
import { generateText } from "ai";
import { openai } from "@ai-sdk/openai";

// Router: Classify task complexity
function selectModel(task: string) {
	const complexitySignals = [
		/calculate|solve|prove|algorithm/i,
		/step-by-step|multi-step/i,
		/\d+\s*[×*÷/]\s*\d+/, // Math operations
	];

	const isComplex = complexitySignals.some((pattern) => pattern.test(task));

	return isComplex
		? openai("o1") // Reasoning model
		: openai("gpt-4o"); // Standard model (fast + cheap)
}

// Use in production
const model = selectModel(userQuery);
const { text } = await generateText({ model, prompt: userQuery });
```

**Pros**:

-   ✅ Cost-optimized (reasoning only when needed)
-   ✅ Fast for simple tasks (95% of requests)
-   ✅ Accurate for complex tasks (5% of requests)

**Cons**:

-   ❌ Requires classification logic
-   ❌ Potential misclassification risk

**When to Use**: Production agents handling mixed workloads

**Key Insight**: Reasoning models excel at **complex reasoning tasks** (math, science, code) but are only marginally better at **factual knowledge**.

## When to Use This Pattern

### ✅ Use Reasoning Models When:

1. **Complex Mathematics**

    - Multi-step calculations requiring verification
    - Example: Scientific simulations, financial modeling, cryptographic operations

2. **Graduate-Level Science**

    - Physics, chemistry, biology problem-solving
    - Example: Drug discovery, materials science research

3. **Algorithm Design & Debugging**

    - Complex code generation requiring logical correctness
    - Example: Competitive programming, systems optimization

4. **Multi-Step Logic Puzzles**
    - Problems requiring backtracking and verification
    - Example: Legal reasoning, strategic planning

### ❌ Use Standard Models When:

1. **Conversational AI**

    - Chat, Q&A, customer support
    - Better alternative: GPT-4o, Claude 4.5, Gemini 2.5 (10-30× cheaper, 10× faster)

2. **Content Generation**

    - Writing, summarization, translation
    - Better alternative: GPT-4o-mini, Gemini 2.5 Flash (50× cheaper)

3. **Simple Code Completion**

    - Boilerplate, basic CRUD, standard patterns
    - Better alternative: Claude 4.5 Haiku, GPT-4o-mini

4. **Factual Retrieval**
    - Answering knowledge questions (not reasoning)
    - Better alternative: RAG with standard model

### Decision Matrix

| Your Situation                       | Recommended Approach      |
| ------------------------------------ | ------------------------- |
| Math proofs, scientific calculations | o3 or DeepSeek-R1         |
| Complex algorithms, debugging        | o1 or Qwen3-235B          |
| Cost-sensitive reasoning             | DeepSeek-R1 (open-source) |
| Mix of simple + complex tasks        | Hybrid (router pattern)   |
| Chat, summarization, simple code     | Standard (GPT-4o, Claude) |
| High-volume, budget-constrained      | Standard (GPT-4o-mini)    |

## Production Best Practices

### 1. Use Hybrid Routing

**Principle**: Only use reasoning models for tasks that need them. Route 90-95% of requests to fast, cheap standard models.

**Implementation Strategy**:

```
Classify request → Route appropriately

Simple (95%):     "Write an email" → GPT-4o (fast + cheap)
Complex (5%):     "Prove theorem X" → o1 (slow + expensive + accurate)
```

**Why**: Saves 80-90% on costs without sacrificing quality.

**Impact**: $10k/month → $2k/month for typical agent workloads.

### 2. Set Reasoning Effort Appropriately

**Principle**: Match reasoning depth to problem complexity. Don't use `high` effort for simple problems.

**Strategy**:

-   **low**: Basic math, simple logic (2-5s, $0.15/1k tokens)
-   **medium**: Code generation, proofs (10-20s, $0.50/1k tokens)
-   **high**: Research, complex algorithms (30-60s, $3.00/1k tokens)

**Why**: Avoid paying for 100-step reasoning on problems solvable in 10 steps.

**Impact**: 3-5× cost reduction for reasoning workloads.

### 3. Extract and Log Reasoning Traces

**Principle**: Use reasoning traces for debugging, evaluation, and user transparency.

```typescript
const enhancedModel = wrapLanguageModel({
	model: groq("deepseek-r1-distill-llama-70b"),
	middleware: extractReasoningMiddleware({ tagName: "think" }),
});

const { reasoning, text } = await generateText({
	model: enhancedModel,
	prompt: "Solve this complex problem...",
});

// Log reasoning for analysis
logger.info({ reasoning, finalAnswer: text, userId });

// Show reasoning to users (optional)
return { answer: text, showReasoning: reasoning };
```

**Why**: Reasoning traces help debug wrong answers, improve prompts, and build user trust.

**Impact**: Reduces debugging time by 60-80% for reasoning failures.

### 4. Cache Reasoning for Repeated Queries

**Principle**: If the same complex problem appears multiple times, cache the reasoning result.

**Strategy**:

```
First request: "Prove X" → Call o1 (60s, $3) → Cache result
Subsequent:    "Prove X" → Return cached result (0s, $0)
```

**Why**: Reasoning models are slow and expensive. Cache aggressively for repeated patterns.

**Impact**: 90%+ cost savings for FAQ-style reasoning queries.

### 5. Monitor Token Usage and Costs

**Principle**: Reasoning models can consume 10-100× more tokens than expected due to internal reasoning.

**What to Track**:

-   Input tokens (prompt)
-   Output tokens (visible answer)
-   **Reasoning tokens** (hidden thinking) ← Can be massive
-   Total cost per request

**Alert Thresholds**:

-   > 5000 tokens per request
-   > $1 per request
-   > 60 seconds latency

**Why**: Runaway reasoning can burn budget quickly. Monitor closely.

## Trade-offs & Considerations

### Advantages

1. **6-8× Better Accuracy**: On complex math, science, and coding tasks
2. **Native Reasoning**: No prompt engineering required for chain-of-thought
3. **Self-Verification**: Models check their own work, reducing errors
4. **Open-Source Options**: DeepSeek-R1, Qwen3 provide customizable alternatives

### Disadvantages

1. **10-30× Higher Cost**: $0.15-3.00 per 1k tokens vs $0.01-0.10 for standard models
2. **10-30× Higher Latency**: 5-60 seconds vs 0.5-2 seconds for standard models
3. **Overkill for Simple Tasks**: Marginal improvement on factual Q&A, chat, summarization
4. **Token Explosion**: Internal reasoning can consume thousands of hidden tokens

### Cost Analysis

**Scenario**: AI coding assistant handling 10,000 queries/month

**Standard Model (GPT-4o)**:

-   Avg 1000 tokens/query × 10,000 queries = 10M tokens
-   Cost: $2.50/1M input + $10/1M output = ~$125/month
-   Latency: 1-2s per query

**Reasoning Model (o1)**:

-   Avg 3000 tokens/query (2000 hidden reasoning) × 10,000 queries = 30M tokens
-   Cost: $150/1M input + $600/1M output = ~$3,750/month
-   Latency: 10-20s per query

**Hybrid Approach (95% standard, 5% reasoning)**:

-   9,500 queries × 1000 tokens = 9.5M tokens (GPT-4o) = ~$119
-   500 queries × 3000 tokens = 1.5M tokens (o1) = ~$187
-   **Total: ~$306/month (75% savings vs pure reasoning)**

## Key Takeaways

1. **Reasoning models think step-by-step automatically** - No prompt engineering required for chain-of-thought
2. **6-8× better on complex tasks** - Math, science, code algorithms see massive accuracy gains
3. **10-30× higher cost and latency** - Use sparingly, only when accuracy justifies expense
4. **Hybrid routing is optimal** - Route simple tasks to standard models, complex tasks to reasoning models
5. **Open-source alternatives exist** - DeepSeek-R1 and Qwen3 match commercial performance at lower cost
6. **Monitor token usage closely** - Internal reasoning can explode token consumption

**Quick Implementation Checklist**:
