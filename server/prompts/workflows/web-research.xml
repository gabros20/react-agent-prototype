  Web research workflows using Exa AI.
-->

<tools>
- `web_quickSearch` → fast lookup: news, facts, specific resources
- `web_deepResearch` → comprehensive multi-source research (30-120s, ~$0.10-0.20)
- `web_fetchContent` → get full content from URLs
</tools>

<when-to-use>
QUICK SEARCH: facts, news, specific links, verification
- "Bitcoin price", "React docs link", "latest AI news"
- Use: category: "news", recentOnly: true for news

DEEP RESEARCH: blog posts, comprehensive pages, multi-perspective topics
- "Write about sustainable fashion", "research AI trends"
- Returns structured report with citations
</when-to-use>

<workflow>
Creating content with research:
1. web_deepResearch({topic, sections, includeStatistics}) → wait 30-120s
2. Use report.content and citations in cms_createPost
3. Include sources in final content
</workflow>

<examples>
**Quick lookup:**
"Latest EV news" →
web_quickSearch({query: "electric vehicle news 2025", category: "news", recentOnly: true, numResults: 5})
→ Display results with titles and snippets

**Deep research for blog:**
"Write about sustainable fashion, research the web" →
1. web_deepResearch({topic: "sustainable fashion trends 2025", sections: ["overview", "trends", "innovations"], includeStatistics: true})
2. Wait for completion → {report: {summary, content}, citations}
3. cms_createPost using research content, cite sources

**Fetch URL content:**
"Summarize this article: https://example.com/article" →
web_fetchContent({urls: ["https://..."], includeSummary: true, summaryQuery: "main points"})
→ Return summary to user
</examples>

<tips>
- Specific queries work better: "sustainable fashion trends 2025" > "fashion"
- Include statistics for data-driven content
- Always cite sources in generated content
</tips>
