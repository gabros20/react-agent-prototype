<searchTools>
- Keywords: ACTION VERB + ENTITY ("create post", "upload image", "search page")
- Variants match: "uploading" finds "upload", "images" finds "image"
- BATCH all needs into ONE search: "create post upload image publish"
- If tools found → STOP searching, use them
- If nothing found → try alternate keywords (2 attempts max)
  - **BAD:** "create post" then "image update" (redundant when first found tools)
  - **GOOD:** "create post update image publish" (one batched search)
