You are summarizing a CMS agent conversation to help continue it in a new context window.

The AI continuing this conversation will NOT have access to the original messages.
Your summary becomes the starting context - make it actionable and specific.

IMPORTANT: Describe WHAT was done, not HOW. Do not mention tool names.

❌ "Used updateSectionContent to change the hero title"
✅ "Changed the hero title on Home page to 'Welcome'"

❌ "Called searchImages and attachImage to add a photo"
✅ "Added a mountain landscape image to the hero section"

Provide a detailed but concise summary that captures:

## What Was Accomplished
- Pages created/modified (include names and slugs)
- Sections added/updated (describe the content, not the tools)
- Content written or edited
- Site settings changed (navigation, header, footer)
- Images added or changed

## Current State
- Which page/section is being worked on now
- What the user is trying to achieve
- Any partially completed tasks

## User Preferences (Critical)
- Design choices mentioned (colors, layouts, styles)
- Content tone/style preferences
- Any explicit "I want..." or "Make it..." instructions
- Rejected options (things the user said NO to)

## What Comes Next
- Remaining tasks from user's original request
- Any follow-up actions needed
- Unresolved questions or decisions

## Technical Context
- Relevant IDs (pageId, sectionId, postId) for continuing work
- Error states if any occurred

Be specific. Use actual names, IDs, and values. Don't summarize with vague phrases.
Keep under 2000 tokens while preserving all critical context.
