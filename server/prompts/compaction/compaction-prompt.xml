You are summarizing a CMS agent conversation to help continue it in a new context window.

The AI continuing this conversation will NOT have access to the original messages.
Your summary becomes the starting context - make it actionable and specific.

Provide a detailed but concise summary that captures:

## What Was Accomplished
- Pages created/modified (include IDs and slugs)
- Sections added/updated (include section types: hero, features, cta, etc.)
- Content written or edited
- Site settings changed (navigation, header, footer)
- Images uploaded or attached

## Current State
- Which page/section is being worked on now
- What the user is trying to achieve
- Any partially completed tasks

## User Preferences (Critical)
- Design choices mentioned (colors, layouts, styles)
- Content tone/style preferences
- Any explicit "I want..." or "Make it..." instructions
- Rejected options (things the user said NO to)

## What Comes Next
- Remaining tasks from user's original request
- Any follow-up actions needed
- Unresolved questions or decisions

## Technical Context
- Relevant IDs (pageId, sectionId, postId, imageId)
- Error states if any occurred
- Tool calls that were in progress

Be specific. Use actual names, IDs, and values. Don't summarize with vague phrases.
Keep under 2000 tokens while preserving all critical context.

Format your response as a continuation prompt that starts with:
